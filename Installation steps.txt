SElinux (Hardening of Linux)
SE Linux stands for security enhanced Linux, which is an access control system that is builtin to 
the Linux kernel .It is used to enforce there source policies that define what level of access users 
,programs ,and services have on a system.
SELinux Operating Modes
SELinux can operate in two global modes:
➢ Permissive mode ,in which permission denials are logged but not enforced.
➢ Enforcing mode ,in which permissions denials are both logged and enforced.
Setting SELinux Modes SELinux runs in one of three modes
1) Disabled: The kernel uses only DAC rules for access control. SELinux does not enforce any 
security policy because no policy is loaded into the kernel.
2) Enforcing :The kernel denies access to users and program sunless permitted by SE Linux 
security policy rules. All denial messages are logged as AVC (Access Vector Cache) denials. This is 
the default mode that enforces SELinux security policy.
3) Permissive :The kernel does not enforce security policy rules but SELinux sends denial
messages to a log file. This allows you to see what actions would have been denied if
SELinux were running in enforcing mode. This mode is intended to used for diagnosing the 
behavior of SELinux.
Commands to Execute SELinux
➢ To install SELinux package in linux system
$ Sudo apt update
$ Sudo apt install policycoreutils selinux-utils selinux-basics
➢ Next command to enable SELinuxon system (execute this command in root terminal)
$ Sudo Selinux-activate
➢ Next, reboot system to apply changes
$ Reboot
➢ Next ,Check the status of selinux
$ sestatus
➢ Next set/change SELinux to enforcing mode
$ sudo selinux-config-enforcing
➢ Next reboot system to apply changes
$ reboot
➢ Next check the status of selinux
$ sestatus
➢ To check mode of SE Linux
$ getenforce
➢ To set the current mode to Enforcing:
$ sudo setenforce enforcing
➢ To set the current mode to Permissive:
$ sudo
$ setenforce permissive
